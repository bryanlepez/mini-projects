**Properties**

- A) We say that a set $X$ of real numbers has property A if:   $\forall x\in\$ $X$, $\exists y\in\$ $X$ $: y > x$
- B) We say that a set $X$ of real numbers has property B if:   $\forall x\in\mathbb{N}$, $\exists y\in\$ $X$ $: y > x$
- C) We say that a set $X$ fo real numbers has property C if:   $\exists y\in\mathbb{N}$, $\forall x\in\$ $X$ $: y \leq x$

## Set 1: The set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ ##

### Property A ### 
Since we have the set $\mathbb{Z}$, we have an infinite amount of positive and negative integers. This means that we have infinitely big and small numbers. 
Therefore, for any integer $x$ there exists an integer $y$ such that $y > x$. For example, if we have a value $x = 100$ then we also have the value $y = x + 1$. This means that 
$y = 101$ which satisfies the inequality of Property A: $101 > 100$. This idea follows for any integer $x$ because we have a set of infinte integers and there will always exist an
integer $y = x + 1$ no matter how big or small $x$ is and that integer $y$ will always be bigger than $x$. Thus, the set $\mathbb{Z}$ satisfies property A.
